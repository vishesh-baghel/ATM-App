## Lessons Learned

I learned a lot from this project. Some of the important concepts that I learned are - 
 - Writing code while keeping the DRY principle in mind. 
 - Learned some great APIs while building some features. For example, when implementing date and current balance features, Instead of hard coding the values, I used built-in functions that gave me flexibility to change the values according to the location of the customer.
